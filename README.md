# Tiny Pieces
TinyPieces is a small vanilla+ mod for 1.14.4 forge. It adds just a few blocks, items, and tweaks that vanilla is missing or is too stupid to do. Does not go over-the-top and isn’t trying to be another Quark. All most all features simply make use of pre-existing items or blocks, with nothing really “radical” added.
